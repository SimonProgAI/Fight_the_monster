# Project Description
Create a simple RPG character builder that allows users to create and customize their characters. The builder should use objects to represent characters, arrays to store character abilities, and sets to store unique character names.

# Features
1. Character Creation: Allow users to create a new character by providing a name, selecting a class (e.g., warrior, mage, rogue), and choosing abilities. // PROMPT enter name or Random name
2. **Character Customization: Enable users to customize their characters by adding or removing abilities, changing their class, or renaming them.**
3. **Ability Management: Store character abilities in an array and allow users to add or remove abilities from their characters.**
4. Unique Character Names: Use a set to store unique character names and prevent users from creating characters with duplicate names.
5. Character Display: Display the created character's details, including their name, class, and abilities. //PROMPT + Console.log()

# Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
1. Objects: Represent characters as objects with properties like name, class, and abilities.
2. Arrays: Store character abilities in an array and use array methods to add or remove abilities.
3. Sets: Use a set to store unique character names and prevent duplicates.
4. Inheritance: Consider using inheritance to create different character classes (e.g., warrior, mage, rogue) that inherit common properties and methods.
